## Doctor Consultation Page - Ultra-Compact Layout

### UI/UX Refinements
- **Ultra-Compact Patient Card (Orange):**
    - Reduced vertical padding further from `py-4` to `py-3`.
    - Reduced avatar icon size from `w-16` to `w-12`.
    - Reduced typography: Patient name (`text-lg`), metadata (`text-[10px]`).
    - Compacted info pills (Age, MRN, Phone) with `py-1` padding.
    - Shrunk the "Resume Session" and "MLC Form" buttons for a more streamlined appearance.
- **Enhanced Readability:** The tighter layout reduces visual noise and ensures the most critical patient identity information is visible without taking up significant screen real estate.
