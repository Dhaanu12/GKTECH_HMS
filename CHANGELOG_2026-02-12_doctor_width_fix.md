## Doctor Consultation Page - Layout Refinement

### UI/UX Refinements
- **Reduced Page Width:** Adjusted the maximum width of the entire consultation dashboard from `7xl` (1280px) to `5xl` (1024px). This makes the interface more condensed, improves readability on wide monitors, and brings the action buttons and patient information closer together for a more focused clinical experience.
- **Improved Focus:** The more narrow layout helps in maintaining visual focus on the central patient data and the AI Clinical Scribe.
