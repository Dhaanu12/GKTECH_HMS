# UI Design Update - Live Vitals Card Color - 2026-02-11

## Objective
Update the background color of the "Live Vitals" card in the Doctor Consultation Page to a beige/sandal tone as requested by the user.

## Changes Implemented
- **Components**: `frontend/app/doctor/patients/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `bg-blue-50/30` (Blue Tint) with `bg-amber-50` (Beige/Sandal Tint) and updated border to `border-amber-200/50`.

## Rationale
User requested a "sandal" or "beige" background color for the card layout instead of the previous white/blue style.
