## Doctor Consultation Page - UI Animations and Layout Adjustments

### UI/UX Refinements
- **Card Order Flip:** Swapped the positions of the **Blood Group** and **Record Vitals** cards in the top action bar to prioritize patient background information.
- **Icon Flip Animation:** Added a premium 3D **rotate-Y flip animation** to the icons in all four action cards (Blood Group, Vitals, Meds, Last Visit). The icons now smoothly flip 180 degrees when the user hovers over the card.
- **Enhanced Focus:** These micro-interactions provide visual feedback and a more dynamic feel to the doctor's clinical dashboard.
