## Doctor Consultation Page - Animation & Layout Refinement

### UI/UX Refinements
- **Card Order Reset:** Swapped the action cards back so that **Record Vitals** is now the first item in the grid, followed by Blood Group, Current Meds, and Last Visit.
- **Auto-Flip on Page Load:** Implemented a new entrance animation. Now, all four action icons automatically perform a full **360-degree flip** shortly after the page is opened, providing a vibrant and engaging loading experience.
- **Persistent Interaction:** Maintained the manual **180-degree flip** on hover, ensuring the dashboard remains interactive and responsive to user focus.
